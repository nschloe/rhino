rhino is a solver package for nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equations. It contains the
respective model evaluators along with an implementation of Newton's method and
optional preconditioner for its linearization.

rhino uses [KryPy](https://github.com/andrenarchy/krypy) for the solution of
linear equation systems and employs its deflation capabilities. The package
[meshplex](https://github.com/nschloe/meshplex) is used to construct the
finite-volume discretization.
